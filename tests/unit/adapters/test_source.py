"""Contract tests for Source.

Source is the path-logic value object shared by every adapter. It composes the
folder layout for a simulation (folder / runs_folder / config_path / run
folders) from a base_folder. It does not rename itself: simulation_name
disambiguation is Repository's responsibility (see
tests/integration/adapters/test_repository.py). These tests pin the path
composition, using tmp_path so nothing touches the real data/ tree.
