"""Custom assertions for adapter tests.

Domain dataclasses hold NumPy arrays (ConnectivityMatrix.data), so plain `==`
between two objects raises "ambiguous truth value". These helpers compare the
graph piece by piece, using np.testing for the array leaves, so failures point
at the exact field that diverged after a serialization round-trip.
