"""Simulation runner for executing a full simulation.

This module defines SimulationRun, the service-layer entry point that drives a
simulation run to completion. It is used by client code to execute a
configured SimulationEngine and collect the resulting history.

Main components:
    SimulationRun: runs a SimulationEngine until the configured duration ends.
